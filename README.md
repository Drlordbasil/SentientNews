# Autonomous News Aggregator and Content Curation

This Python project aims to create an autonomous news aggregator and content curation system that operates entirely without local files on the user's PC. The system will scrape news websites and RSS feeds to collect the latest news articles, blog posts, and other relevant content. It will then perform content extraction, topic extraction, sentiment analysis, and provide content recommendations based on the user's reading history. Additionally, the system will integrate with social media platforms for content promotion and advertising placements for revenue generation.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping**: The program will scrape multiple news websites and RSS feeds to collect the latest news articles, blog posts, and other relevant content. It will utilize tools like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure and extract necessary information.

2. **Content Extraction**: The program will use natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from web pages and eliminate any unnecessary content. It will extract the article title, author, publication date, main text, and related metadata.

3. **Topic Extraction and Categorization**: The program will utilize HuggingFace small models or other NLP tools to perform topic extraction and categorization. It will categorize the collected content into various topics or industries based on keywords, themes, or relevant metadata.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The program will employ sentiment analysis algorithms to evaluate the sentiment of each news article or blog post. It will analyze the text to identify whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. This feature will help in assessing the general tone of the articles and provide a better understanding of their impact.

5. **Content Recommendations**: The program will utilize machine learning algorithms, collaborative filtering techniques, or content-based filtering to provide personalized content recommendations to the users. It will analyze the user's reading history, interests, and engagement patterns to generate highly relevant and engaging content suggestions.

6. **Social Media Integration**: The program will autonomously create social media posts to promote the curated content. It will utilize APIs or scraping techniques to retrieve data from social media platforms and analyze engagement rates, audience demographics, and social trends to optimize the content distribution strategy.

7. **Advertising Integration**: The program will autonomously integrate advertising placements within the curated content. It will analyze market trends, identify potential advertisers, and negotiate advertising rates or partnerships. This feature will help in generating revenue through sponsored content or advertising placements.

8. **Dynamic Updates**: The program will continuously monitor news sources and update the content database with the latest articles and blog posts. It will employ techniques like web scraping, RSS feeds, or API integration to stay up-to-date with new content.

## Benefits

1. **Passive Revenue Generation**: The program will automate the content aggregation, curation, and advertising processes, allowing for passive revenue generation through sponsored content and advertising placements.

2. **Scalability**: As the program operates autonomously and retrieves content from the web, it can scale up its operations without impacting the user's PC or requiring additional resources.

3. **Personalized User Experience**: By utilizing NLP and machine learning techniques, the program will provide highly personalized content recommendations based on user preferences, leading to better user engagement and satisfaction.

4. **Time-Saving**: By automating the content aggregation and curation tasks, users like freelance writers or content creators can save time and focus on other aspects of their work, such as content writing or marketing.

5. **Enhanced Content Discovery**: The program will help users discover new and relevant content from various sources, expanding their knowledge and allowing them to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and news.
